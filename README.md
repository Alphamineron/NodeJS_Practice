This is a repository of a set of Node.js projects I made with the intention of learning and experimentation.

# Projects
List of **noteworthy projects** implemented in this practice repo:
1. [Simple Sentiment Analysis Practice Project](https://github.com/Alphamineron/NodeJS_Practice/tree/master/2_): Just trying out Node.js and Express framework for the first time, this is supposed to
be a simple "Lookup Table" sorta Sentiment Analysis project consisting of an `Express server`
backend dealing with JSON files and a `vanila HTML/CSS/JS` frontend client to provide an
interface to the backend api.
